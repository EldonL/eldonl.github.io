ARSession is the main entry point to the ARCore API. It manages the AR system state and handles the session lifecycle, allowing the app to create, configure, start, or stop a session. Most importantly, it enables the app to receive frames that allow access to the camera image and device pose" in short an AR Session " Controls the lifecycle of an AR experience"</span>

In this one, the user presses a button to enable/disable the planes. Analyzing the PlaneDetectionController.cs, I learned two things: (1) I can loop through ARPlaneManager and enable or disable all trackables such as planes by doing 
                    <code>foreach (var plane in m_ARPlaneManager.trackables) plane.gameObject.SetActive(value);</code>where m_ARPlaneManager is a class member variable of type <code>ARPlaneManager</code> (2) and second is I can check or set if the ARPlaneManager is enabled by calling the enabled property like this <code>m_ARPlaneManager.enabled = !m_ARPlaneManager.enabled;</code></span>

Check the youtube playlist to see the result!</span>

                    <span slot ="action18text">Next is to do facetracking. Start of simple and have a Red nose! I created a new scene and added AR Session and AR Session Origin to the scene. Since By default the AR Face Manager instantiates the prefab at the origin point which is defined as the Center of a user's head (located inside the skull behind the nose), all I need to do is attach the AR Face Manager component to AR Session Origin. The face prefab I attached is a Red sphere - which I had to lower the scale to 0.05 on all axis</span>

In this case, there can always only be 1 face. The second dictionary key stores the regions (left forehead, right forehead and nose). The last dictionary key will store the gameobject id to spawn.

There is no check for duplicate name conflicts. <code>Specify Size</code> - if enabled, you can specify the physical size you expect the image to be in the real world, may be mandatory for some providers (the image tracking subsystem is an interface which is implemented in other packages. Each implementation is called a provider", e.g different provider package for each AR platform). If you edit one dimension (e.g width) causes the other dimension (height) to change automatically based on the image's aspect ratio. <code>Keep Texture at Runtime</code>-If enabled, XRReferenceImage.texture contains a reference to the source texture. useful if you need access to the source texture at runtime.
