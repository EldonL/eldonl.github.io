                    <span slot ="action1text">This is part 3 of making my first Android Game. If you missed part2, you can find it <a href="blogfirstandroidgame2.html">here</a></span>
                    <span slot ="action2text">It was time to get some ALPHA testers! I happened to be layed off and there was a career fair happening held by DigiBC. So I thought this was a good way to showcase my android experience with this game and have them test. The best part was they would only play for 15 seconds to 1 minute. By watching the recruiters play, I can learn what I need to improve on</span>

                    <span slot ="action3text">1) No one knew what to do with their fingers. They didn't know the player could be moved. Even when I tell them the player follows the finger, they initially thought the player will go anywhere, but it is only on the x axis. Therefore I need to consider including a tutorial or some sort of arrow indication.</span>

                    <span slot ="action4text">2) They had no clue there was a weapon selection button. I need to notify the user at the beginning</span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">3) No one knew that after clicking a weapon button, then clicking the select button, they needed to select the "x" button to close the window. They all assumed the "select" button was the close button. I should change it so the "select" button is the close button.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/whatyoubuymenuselectclose.PNG" slot="action5image">
                    <span slot ="action6text">4)Some users didn't know what to collect or dodge. They weren't sure if the coins were to be collected or not. I probably need a tutorial</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/coinscollected.gif" slot="action6image">
                    <span slot ="action7text">To resolve the select button not closing on the what you have to buy menu. I made the select button do what the close button does in addition to what the select button already does. So now when the user selects a weapon then clicks the "select" button, the menu closes and the game continues</span>

                    <span slot ="action8text">To resolve user not knowing what to collect, dodge or when to press the select button. I added a how to play button and how to play menu in the Start scene</span>
