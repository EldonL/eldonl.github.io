                    <span slot ="action2text">It was time to get some ALPHA testers! I happened to be layed off and there was a career fair happening held by DigiBC. So I thought this was a good way to showcase my android experience with this game and have them test. The best part was they would only play for 15 seconds to 1 minute. By watching the recruiters play, I can learn what I need to improve on</span>

                    <span slot ="action3text">1) No one knew what to do with their fingers. They didn't know the player could be moved. Even when I tell them the player follows the finger, they initially thought the player will go anywhere, but it is only on the x axis. Therefore I need to consider including a tutorial or some sort of arrow indication.</span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">3) No one knew that after clicking a weapon button, then clicking the select button, they needed to select the "x" button to close the window. They all assumed the "select" button was the close button. I should change it so the "select" button is the close button.</span>
