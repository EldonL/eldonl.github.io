                <span slot ="action3text">Since there were different POS systems (Aloha, IGourmet, OrcaPOS), this meant there are different functions and settings. I had to make sure that all edge cases were tested thoroughly, this included from the user creating the menu, to the cashier using the pos system, to the receipt being printed out. Below is an example of the cashier coming back from their break on Aloha system</span>

                <span slot ="action3text">Getting to QA all the systems, I was curious on how the programming side worked. I asked my manager if I can do some programming for OrcaPOS. It was approved and I got to help fix some bugs. The bugs included debugging why the following were not behaving properly: adding extra notes on the receipt for the chef, phone orders, receipt printing the wrong amount of orders. It turned out that in the database, there were primary keys in database not referenced properly in another table</span>
