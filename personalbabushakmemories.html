                <span slot ="task">In a team of 7 (5 developers and 2 modelers) besides one person, it was my first time meeting them. My role as the developer was in charge of setting up a vr environment, upload the build on oculus dashboard, generate keystores and make raycast select objects and what happens to them when selected. </span>
                <span slot ="action1text">One of the first items to interact was to pick up a watering can. To make the watering can follow the hand, I decided to child gameobjects to the hand. However, I couldn't just child it to the hand directly, because the watering can and the hand would clip too much. I added another empty gameobject to the hand that was slightly in front of the hand. Then child the watering can to the empty gameobject</span>

                <span slot ="action2text">Another item to interact with was the cabinet. When the raycast hovers over the cabinet, it would get highlighted. Using a separate material, when the raycast interacts with the cabinet, the material would be enabled</span>

                <span slot ="action3text">Since I was in charge of making the android build. I was in charge of merging as well. As the artists make changes, I would merge them in. Below shows that the grandma's house was still in progress, we still needed a window</span>
