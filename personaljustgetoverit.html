                <span slot ="situation">Hosted by Simon Fraser Student Society and the Software Systems Student Society. This is the 12 hours Systems Hack- "Loveathon".</span>
                <span slot ="task">I was in a group of 3 - with 2 other developers. As I was more familiar with VR, my task was to make sure all the vr equipment was ready and my teammates know how to install Unity. I also was the more experienced programmer so I had to help delegate tasks and set up Unity Collaborate as a source repository. The goal was to create a Valentine game and I wanted to make a VR game</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">The group I was with- we had been in a different hackathon in the past so I knew what tasks to delegate. We needed someone to work on art - but since it's only 12 hours and we were all developers, I tasked one of them to look for assets. I tasked another developer to start working on the anger scene. I started working on the menu scene. The denial scene would come later.</span>
                <span slot ="action2text">I wanted the user to interact with the menu in the main scene to choose which character they want to be by touching the buttons. I used OnTriggerEnter for the interactions.</span>
                <span slot ="action2text">In the denial scene, I discussed with my team members on what we wanted, and we thought it would be fun to shoot at incoming objects in VR. I implemented a timer that would spawn anger messages in the form of cubes. I used OnCollisionEnter to have the bullets destroy the anger messages. After x amount of messages have been destroyed, it will change scene to the denial scene</span>
                
                <span slot ="result1text">After finishing the funtionality in the main menu scene, I merged my changes with the assets that my team member found which included a grass field scene with bird sounds</span>

                <span slot ="result2text">When the denial scene implementation was done. I merged my changes with the assets my team member found which involved a sci fi gun to replace my cube gun that I was using as whitebox</span>

                <span slot ="result4text">The anger scene was not on my branch yet, but I already knew the name of the scene ahead of time so I had already put the name of the anger scene in my branch. Once my team member finished implementing the anger scene, I merged the changes in, did a quick test to make sure the scene change worked and we were done</span>
