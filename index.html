					<h1>From past game jams experience, getting the game to work was not enough, I had to make it look good as well. However, with no experience in building horizon world, I had to learn the code basics first and whitebox. I knew I wanted to do tech history, but how do I execute it? I first started off just making "mystery boxes" and when I collide with it, it will open up and show a piece of tech history. I then started adding "stars" which acts as tickets to open the box. The problem was the user had no idea what they were collecting, so I made a ticket board where the user can view what tickets they have. At the time my world was just mystery boxes and stars. That was boring, so I decided to use a maze, but not just any maze- a pacman shaped maze! And if anyone recognize the shape of the maze, I encouraged them to take a picture and share what they think the maze shape is based on. I was running out of time at the end and making mystery boxes was getting hard, so I started placing objects around the world that showed tech history with the name of the person on it. This allowed users to not only look for star tickets but just casually walk around the world and challenge themselves to see how many names they recognize. I hope to add more mystery boxes when the judging period is over.

				<div class="setUpDescription">(1) I started off prototyping to make sure that the database images from Vuforia would be detected by making a 3D object appear such as a cube or sphere </div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(2)Once I was sure all images will be detected I tried to make sure a single 2D sprite image can appear. Then I tried adding more sprites to see if detecing an image can make multiple images appear-spoiler alert: it did! </div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(3) Then I attempted to use animations to make a "slide show", but that failed miserably. So I decdied to use code instead. I created a Sprite array and use coroutines to change sprites every x amount of seconds specified in the inspector.</div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(4) Once the images appeared, I tried to make any audio play sound when an image is detected.</div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(5) Then once I know audio works I started looking for audios on Youtube (then used Youtube to mp3 converter and then mp3 cutter)</div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(6) I noticed that when an image stops getting detected and using audioSource.Stop(), the audio stop abruptly, sounding weird. So I decided to fade the audio out using a AudioMixer.</div>
				<div class="setUpDescription">(7) Then I started adding extra affects such as making images rotate and particle affects. Since each image detected may have different amount of sprites, or the time it takes to change sprites are different, I made sure to make those values public so I can edit the seconds/numbers in the inspector.  </div>

				Then I do a test run with basic shapes and then will either import fbx objects from the asset store or create them from Blender/Maya. The objects made in Blender/Maya
				are the airplane in the web sling scene and Puffer Fish robot scene, the boxes in the websling scene, the web in the main menu,
				the Puffer Fish Robots, and the balloons in the shooting scene.

				<div class="setUpDescription">Jun-Aug 2018. Made in Visual Studios-The purpose of this project is to implement AR into the school system to teach children to recognize shape in a more interactive way.
				To make it interactive, the children will show shape(s) in front of a webcam that is playing live video. The program will then identify and label the shape. The AR part comes into play when a 3D overlay is drawn over the shape</div>

				<div>Process</div>
				<h1> This project was done in a group of 3. My task was to figure out how to label, identify and draw a 3D overlay on the shapes during a live video.
				I first started with just a still image that has multiple shapes saved as a PNG file. I would convert these images to gray scale and then binarized them using the gaussian
				filter and Canny threshold. I then tried to connect to the webcam and tried taking a picture and see if the shapes are being recognized. Once the previous steps were completed, I now had to figure out how to make the program recognize shapes LIVE, which means
				I needed to create a loop for the program to recognize the contours of the shapes each frame. The twist to labeling and drawing a 3D overlay on the shapes during live video is that the overlay must follow the shape. This issue was solved
				by making the drawing and labeling in the same loop as the contour recognition section.

				<div class="setUpDescription">Feb 2018. Made In Unity-The theme of that hackathon is Love. We made a game called "Just Get Over It". If you have ever been in love, you know
				there are different stages. We created two stages- Denial and Anger. In the Denial level, you must shoot at incoming love boxes the says "Get Over It" and  "Try to get back together". The Anger level lets you hit a box with a heart shape to let your anger out!
				I would like to thank the my teammates-"VR Team", Circuit Stream for lending me the Oculus Rift, Simon Fraser Student Society and the Software Systems Student Society for hosting this 12 hours Systems Hack- "Loveathon". We got placed in 3rd out of 17 teams</div>

				<h1> My teamates- Karina and Mike- and I called our team the "VR Team". It's not fancy, but it tells you what we do exactly! This is our second time working together.
				The first time was at the <a href="#Lumania">LumoHacks-Lumania</a>. With our experience from the first hackathon, we had an idea on how to split up the task. However,
				coming up with the idea and trying to execute it was extremely hard due to the time constraint. Luckily, the tasks we split up were according to our strengths
				and we finished what we imagine into (virtual) reality!
				</h1>

				<h1>Eldon (That's me!)- Setup Oculus Rift, create base class for interactions with the rift, programmed interactions in the main menu, created the button in the main menu, programmed the Denial Scene for love boxes to be destroyed</h1>
				<h1>Karina- Designer, audio, programmed instantiation of bullets and love boxes, movement of bullets and movement of love boxes and presented the game</h1>
				<h1>Mike- Created interactions in the Anger Scene, animated the hands, demonstrated the game</h1>

				<div class="setUpDescription">September 2017. Made In Unity: This game was created at a Hackathon called LumoHacks. The topic for my group was
				"Mental distress and depression in young people". This game helps people with mental health. Each day for 30 days, the user follows a friend-a gender of the user's choice-who
				will lead the user into different doors. Each door leads the user to a new task that boost their confidence. The user will play this game at the same time
				everyday to help them get used to a daily routine.  Currently we have one task called "The Dancing Challenge" that encourages the
				user to dance along with a dancing rabbit! This game was placed top 15 out of 60 teams! Huge thanks to my teamates Karina,Mike and Warren </div>

				<h1>Two of our members were using Unity for the first time. So the tasks we assigned to each other must match our
				abilities to ensure we can finish it within 24 hours. three weeks before the hackathon started, I reviewed how Google VR works and began setting up and testing GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage using Android Studio
				so my teammates can start hacking right away. Our tasks were split up accordingly:
				<h1>Eldon: Setup the player with GoogleVrPackage, setup Unity Collaborate(was free at the time),getting the player to choose a door and change scene when entering </h1>
				<h1>Karina: Voice of the friend, music for the dancing scene, getting the animation of the friend to work, selecting a good looking texture for the doors</h1>
				<h1>Mike: Selecting a friend at the main menu, timer for the dancing scene, text for explaning what to do in the dancing scene</h1>
				<h1>Warren: Finding the "friend" from the asset store, getting the animation of the friend to work, getting the sound of friend to work </h1>
				<h1></h1>
