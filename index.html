    	    <div class="setUpDescription">Sept 2017-Present. Made In Unity: You are a superhero with Spiderman powers. You must complete your training to join
             the Avengers. However, while you are training, real evil arises. With the AI installed in your suit by none other then
              Mr.Stark himself, you must battle your way through with what you have installed by destroying pumpkin bombs, PufferFish Robots and swing objects around!
              There are currently two levels for the user to play as Spidey Hero! The first level starts of as a
              target practice shooting balloons using rapid webs. However, MegaGoblin suddenly appears out of a giant portal from the sky
              throwing pumpkin bombs! If the pumpkin bombs hits you, your health goes down. You lose when you have zero health.
              The second level you are at the enemies headquarters. You must salvage as many materials as possible into an airplane before the enemies
              discover you! Thanks to Circuit Stream for providing feedback from September to December 2017, I have learned alot from them! </div>

	<h1>Biggest challenge for Spidey Hero was transferring what I imagined on paper into reality. Since this game was my idea, I was the only person 
who knew how I want the scene to look like. For each scene I create, I would first draw it on paper, then write a flow chart of how the weapons would work. 
Then I do a test run with basic shapes and then will either import fbx objects from the asset store or create them from Blender. The objects made from blender
are the airplane in the web sling scene, the boxes in the websling scene, the web in the main menu and the balloons in the shooting scene.

    	    <div class="setUpDescription">Jun-Aug 2018. Made in Visual Studios-The purpose of this project is to implement AR into the school system to teach children to recognize shape in a more interactive way. 
To make it interactive, the children will show shape(s) in front of a webcam that is playing live video. The program will then identify and label the shape. The AR part comes into play when a 3D overlay is drawn over the shape</div>

 	<div>Process</div>
		<h1> This project was done in a group of 3. My task was to figure out how to label, identify and draw a 3D overlay on the shapes during a live video. 
I first started with just a still image that has multiple shapes saved as a PNG file. I would convert these images to gray scale and then binarized them using the gaussian
filter and Canny threshold. I then tried to connect to the webcam and tried taking a picture and see if the shapes are being recognized. Once the previous steps were completed, I now had to figure out how to make the program recognize shapes LIVE, which means
I needed to create a loop for the program to recognize the contours of the shapes each frame. The twist to labeling and drawing a 3D overlay on the shapes during live video is that the overlay must follow the shape. This issue was solved
by making the drawing and labeling in the same loop as the contour recognition section.

I would like to thank the my teammates-"VR Team", Circuit Stream for lending me the Oculus Rift, Simon Fraser Student Society and the Software Systems Student Society for hosting this 12 hours Systems Hack- "Loveathon". We got placed in 3rd out of 17 teams</div>

The first time was at the <a href="#Lumania">LumoHacks-Lumania</a>. With our experience from the first hackathon, we had an idea on how to split up the task. However, 
coming up with the idea and trying to execute it was extremely hard due to the time constraint. Luckily, the tasks we split up were according to our strengths
and we finished what we imagine into (virtual) reality!

<h1>Eldon (That's me!)- Setup Oculus Rift, create base class for interactions with the rift, programmed interactions in the main menu, created the button in the main menu, programmed the Denial Scene for love boxes to be destroyed</h1>
<h1>Karina- Designer, audio, programmed instantiation of bullets and love boxes, movement of bullets and movement of love boxes and presented the game</h1>
<h1>Mike- Created interactions in the Anger Scene, animated the hands, demonstrated the game</h1>

"Mental distress and depression in young people". This game helps people with mental health. Each day for 30 days, the user follows a friend-a gender of the user's choice-who
will lead the user into different doors. Each door leads the user to a new task that boost their confidence. The user will play this game at the same time 
everyday to help them get used to a daily routine.  Currently we have one task called "The Dancing Challenge" that encourages the 
user to dance along with a dancing rabbit! This game was placed top 15 out of 60 teams! Huge thanks to my teamates Karina Khartanovich,Mike Xu and Warren Chan</div>

abilities to ensure we can finish it within 24 hours. three weeks before the hackathon started, I reviewed how Google VR works and began setting up and testing GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage using Android Studio
so my teammates can start hacking right away. Our tasks were split up accordingly: 
<h1>Eldon: Setup the player with GoogleVrPackage, setup Unity Collaborate(was free at the time),getting the player to choose a door and change scene when entering </h1> 
<h1>Karina: Voice of the friend, music for the dancing scene, getting the animation of the friend to work, selecting a good looking texture for the doors</h1> 
<h1>Mike: Selecting a friend at the main menu, timer for the dancing scene, text for explaning what to do in the dancing scene</h1>
<h1>Warren: Finding the "friend" from the asset store, getting the animation of the friend to work, getting the sound of friend to work </h1>
