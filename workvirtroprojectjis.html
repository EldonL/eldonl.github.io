                <span slot ="situation">Originally Job Interviews Simulations were only developed on the Oculus GO. Now it has been developed for Meta Quest and WebGL. This app is public and being used by schools, immigrants and job seekers  </span>
                <span slot ="task">One of my proudest projects at Virtro Technology Inc. I had the opportunity to work on this project from the very start. Including whiteboxing, planning meetings, going through multiple alpha and beta versions to production</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">The beginning was whiteboxing and trying to find out the best setup for an interview space. One of my coworkers and I put together many interview rooms using cubes to whitebox. After many iterations we came up with 3 interview rooms to use</span>
                <!-- <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/virtro.png" slot="action1image">                 -->
                <span slot ="action2text">We wanted the user to interact with different AI interviewers. Working with the backend team, we came up with a way to mix and match the interviewers and the rooms.</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/jis/characters.PNG" slot="action2image">                
                <span slot ="action3text">In the interview rooms, there are different seating locations at different tables. I came up with a way so that both the player and interviewer would spawn at the correct seating locations no matter how many tables or chairs there are in the scene. I made sure that the implementation worked for both VR and WebGL scenes</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/jis/gibsonwebgl.PNG" slot="action3image">                
                <span slot ="action4text">While the interviewer is listening to your answers, the interviewer would be performing random animations. Working with one of my co-worker, we came up with a way to randomize the animations for all the characters using the same implementation to avoid repeating code</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/jis/connievr.PNG" slot="action4image">                
                <span slot ="action5text">One of the best parts of this app is that it is data driven. If more jobs are added to this app, we would not need to make additional builds. The lobby - where the user can search for jobs - will search for the new data and display the new jobs. I made sure that pagination is functioning in case more jobs are added then the page can fit. Below is the webgl version of the lobby</span>

                <span slot ="action7text">This app also has a login so that we can customize the experience for each user. This included entitlements to the app, analytics on their interview, and a transcript for teachers or students to review their performance. I made sure the right stats get sent to the user such as number of questions answered and session time. I also helped with implementing the login scene for both VR and WebGL.</span>

                <span slot ="result1text">An example of what the webgl version of the interview looked like this. As you can see we added a frame to simulate being interviewed online.</span>
