                <span slot ="situation">Set up the project and create a practice scene that allows the user to make as many mistakes as they want without being penalized. Once the user is ready, they can proceed to the real scenarios. </span>
                <span slot ="task">The practice scene I had to set up was to have the user say the text that appears on the screen. Based on how well the user says something, a score will be displayed. The user can also pause at any time and end the conversation at any time.</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">When WBLC had asked for a learning app from us, we had already created <a href="workvirtroprojectjis.html">BeConfident</a>, <a href="workvirtroprojectlinclingo.html">LincLingo</a>, <a href="workvirtroprojectdnd.html">DND</a> and many more. Luckily, months before, my team and I had already written a standardization document. My job was to document how to set up Unity in a gitlab project (gitignore, what to push and branches to create), and how to set up basic scenes and prefabs such as a login scene and player prefab. This turned out to be useful when setting up WBLC as it saved us a lot of time. Shoutout to gitlab (logo shown below)</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/wblc/gitlab.png" slot="action1image">                
                <span slot ="action2text">One part of the practice scene was displaying the score. A High score, medium score and low score. Each score range will display a number of stars, a color scheme and an encouragement text. The score would slide from the bottom of the screen. I had to plan out how to code the scores and make the score appear. To make the score appear I used dotween. The score range was to be used in other places as well, so I did not want to redefine the scores again. So I made the score range static so I can reuse them. E.g if high score display 3 stars, display blue color and show "well done". Since the score range was static, I did not have to have the code for the stars, color scheme and encouragement text in the same script which made it more flexible.</span>

                <span slot ="action3text">I made sure the speaker icon can be enabled/recording or disabled/not recording. It is enabled if the users turn to talk. It is disabled if the game is paused, the user ends the conversation, the score appears. To do this, I made events for those cases. This proved to be useful, because if other occurrence requires an action from those cases, I can simply subscribe to those events</span>

                <span slot ="action4text">I checked that the text the user should say gets updated. I would retrieve the text and save them into a queue. If the user wants to try again, the same text appears. If they don't want to practice anymore, I would remove the text from the list. If the user wants to save for later, the text would be moved to the bottom of the queue.</span>

                <span slot ="action5text">The score is calculated based on how close the user pronounces the text. By teaming up with the framework team who has connected Microsoft LUIS - an intent engine - I could implement a scoring algorithm provided by the content team. Shoutout to my team and microsoft LUIS (logo shown below)</span>
