                <span slot ="action1text">I knew I wanted to do a tech history learning adventure. To get use to coding in a VR headset for long periods of time, I would increase my time in a headset by 10minutes. I had ideas of making "mystery boxes" and when the user collides with the boxes, it will open up and show a piece of tech history. Instead of getting everything to work and look good, I tried to get the collision working first. Once I got that to work, I added another level to it, instead of only colliding with the box, I have to collect star tickets, these tickets were keys to opening the mystery boxes. Since I already learned how collision works, setting up collision with the star keys was much easier. </span>
                <span slot ="result1text">After all the main functionalities was implemented, it was time to make it look good. so I decided to use a maze, but not just any maze- a (spoiler alert) pacman shaped maze! And if anyone recognize the shape of the maze, I encouraged them to take a picture and share what they think the maze shape is based on. </span>

                <span slot ="result2text">Just having boxes, stars and a maze felt boring. Therefore, I started placing objects around the world that showed tech history with the name of the person on it. This allowed users to not only look for star tickets but just casually explore the world and challenge themselves to see how many names they recognize. </span>
