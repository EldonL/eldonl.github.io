                    <span slot ="action2text">It was time to create the Start Menu. Using my Figma design as a reference. See image below</span>

                    <span slot ="action3text">The Figma design seemed a little too messy with buttons in random places. I decided to place the buttons in the middle vertically down, and the title in the middle. I also added tomatoes with different skins and potatoes as decorations</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/mainmenuoriginal.PNG" slot="action3image">   
                    <span slot ="action4text">At first it looked ok, but when I sideloaded the build on to the phone, I noticed the title did not pop out. The decorations were too distracting. I wanted the user to notice the title first, then the buttons, then the decorations. Therefore I made the title background darker so it makes the title text pop out more. Added eyeballs to the tomato title of the "o"s. Made the ALPHA value lower for the buttons and the decorations so they don't pop out as more. Moved the decorations beside the buttons so it corresponds with "1 player" and "2 player", instead of randomly placing the decorations. This allowed the title to be seen first, then the buttons then the decorations and background. The 1 player button brings the user the the Game Scene and the Quit button quits the application</span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">I made a build to see how the transition would feel from start menu to game scene. When the user presses "1 player" button, the game scene loads right away and the players must start playing. This felt a little too sudden. Therefore, I decided to set the Time.timeScale=0 when the user presses "1 player" button. Then at the beginning of the game scene, there is a countdown that takes about 3 seconds before the enemies appear. This allows the user to think instead of rushing in</span>
