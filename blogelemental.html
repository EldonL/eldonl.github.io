I came up with a way so that both the player and interviewer would spawn at the correct seating locations no matter how many tables or chairs there are in the scene. I made sure that the implementation worked for both VR and WebGL scenes</span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">One of the best parts of this app is that it is data driven. If more jobs are added to this app, we would not need to make additional builds. The lobby - where the user can search for jobs - will search for the new data and display the new jobs. I made sure that pagination is functioning in case more jobs are added then the page can fit. Below is the webgl version of the lobby</span>

                    <span slot ="action7text">This app also has a login so that we can customize the experience for each user. This included entitlements to the app, analytics on their interview, and a transcript for teachers or students to review their performance. I made sure the right stats get sent to the user such as number of questions answered and session time. I also helped with implementing the login scene for both VR and WebGL.</span>
