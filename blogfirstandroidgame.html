                    <span slot ="action1text">This blog will describe what I encountered while making my first Android game. I am using 2021.3.16f1. I wasn't familiar on how the UI would look on a phone vs in editor. Below is in Editor</span>

                    <span slot ="action2text">On the phone in vertical mode. You can see the player is in the wrong position. This may be due to the UIs being in world space</span>

                    <span slot ="action3text">On the phone in horizontal mode. You can see the UI does not span across the phone</span>

                    <span slot ="action4text">I was also unsure what happens on a phone when I do GetMouseButtonDown. So I tested out the code below and turns out GetMouseButtonDown is same thing as tap on the phone</span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">So now that I know an android build works on my Samsung Galaxy S10. I need to come up with a game, UI design and decide if my game will stay in one orientation or not -vertical, horizontal or both. I wanted to make a game called tomatos vs potatos.

                    <span slot ="action7text">This app also has a login so that we can customize the experience for each user. This included entitlements to the app, analytics on their interview, and a transcript for teachers or students to review their performance. I made sure the right stats get sent to the user such as number of questions answered and session time. I also helped with implementing the login scene for both VR and WebGL.</span>
