                <span slot ="situation">Unity Global Student Challenge 2019. Projects must revolve around the theme of "Teach people something new." </span>
                <span slot ="task">One of the criteria was to include Cinemachine and timeline in our game. I decided to teach people about nocturnal animals, because at night when we are asleep we do not see enough what is happening at night so we may not appreciate what is happening out there</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">Since this was a limited event. I wanted to focus on coding because I was a developer so any animal assets I wanted to use, I did not want to spend time making models of these animals. So I found Unity Assets of nocturnal animals such as a bat and raccoon. I setup Oculus Integration and made sure the raycast was functioning</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/TheLateLateAnimals/beginninggif.gif" slot="action1image">
                <span slot ="action2text">I wanted to display a bat using echolocation to look for mosquitos. I imported the bat and found a flying animation to use. I used a sphere as the mosquito and programmed it to fly in random directions but within a small radius. Using particles to simulate a trail of where the mosquito was flying. I did a test in an empty scene to make the bat was functioning</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/TheLateLateAnimals/BatPowerGif.gif" slot="action2image">
                <span slot ="action3text">Another idea was to show a raccoon stealing food from the garbage can. Using timeline I made the raccoon run from one spot to the garbage can. Then use particles for a special effect to indicate the raccoon has successfully stolen food</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/TheLateLateAnimals/RaccoonGif.gif" slot="action3image">
                <span slot ="action4text">The frog was another animal I thought to showcase. I imagined a frog using it's tongue to capture mosquitoes. I thought of when the mosquito has entered a empty box collider placed in front of the frog, the frog would play an animation and stick its tongue out. </span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/TheLateLateAnimals/FrogBoxCollider.PNG" slot="action4image">
                <span slot ="action5text">Just showing the animal's powers was fun, but I would like the user to interact in VR, after all, I had a raycast setup. So to add another layer of education, I would have a food machine appear out of a gate asking the user to select the food that one of the nocturnal animals would eat. If they are correct, they would see the animal's power. If they are wrong, they get to try again. The hardest part of implementing this game was randomizing the food. I wanted the user to learn a variety of food that the animals eat, so each time they play, they would see a new set of food to choose from. In case the user has never seen one of the food before, I would also display the text of the food. This was implemented by displaying the gameobjects name when the user hovers over the food. Each power is implemented in its own scene and I would use the loadScene function to load in the superpowers</span>

                <span slot ="action6text">I needed to think of a way to incorporate cinemachine, so I decided to use cinemachine as my intro. Below is my beginning phase of trying to setup cinemachine</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/TheLateLateAnimals/CinemachineSetup.PNG" slot="action6image">
                <span slot ="result1text">I completed my cinemachine setup introduction scene that showcases all the animals. Below is a screenshot of a raccoon in my introduction</span>

                <span slot ="result2text">I successfully finished implementing all the powers. Below is a screen shot of the wolves superpower</span>

                <span slot ="result3text">To let the user have full power. I let them choose which animal they would like to learn before the pick the food and see their powers. Below shows what the user sees while they decide to pick an animal</span>
