                    <span slot ="action1text">This is part 22 of making my first Android Game. If you missed part21, you can find it <a href="blogfirstandroidgame21.html">here</a>.</span>
                    <span slot ="action2text">Firebase is an app development platform that can help with a backend infrastructure such as authentication. Helps with releases and monitoring such as crashlytics and performance monitoring. While exploring how to save data such as using <a href="blogfirstandroidgame20.html">MAMP</a> and <a href="blogfirstandroidgame21.html">playerprefs</a>, firebase has come across my radar as another option. I visited the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase website </a>and clicked "Get Started". I created a project called tomato-vs-potato</span>

                    <span slot ="action3text">I am using the Spark Plan instead of Blaze- which is pay as you go. Spark Plan has usage quotas for database, firestore, storage, phone auth, hosting and Test Lab as well as analytics, notifications, crash reporting etc. It does not have the ability to extend the project with google cloud.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/firebase1.PNG" slot="action3image">
                    <span slot ="action4text">I added an app to get started. First step is to enter my bundle identifier (apple) and package name (google play). </span>

                    <span slot ="action5text">Next is to download the config files</span>

                    <span slot ="action6text">Then import the Firebase Unity SDK. The current version is 11.6.0. As of now I'm not sure what other <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup?hl=en&authuser=0&_gl=1*7f7t6p*_ga*MzQ1MDkxMzg2LjE3MDE2NDE1NTc.*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTcwMTY2MDE4NC4zLjEuMTcwMTY2MDYxNS4xOS4wLjA.#available-libraries">firebase products</a> to import yet</span>

                    <span slot ="action8text">I can place the google service files anywhere in the assets folder. Therefore, I placed in Assets/Plugins/Firebase folder</span>

                    <span slot ="action9text">I unzip the firebase unity sdk and unzipped and saw many unity packages including FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFireStore, FirebaseFunctions etc. I may need to use these eventually. However, for now I only need FirebaseAnalytics</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/firebase7.PNG" slot="action9image">
                    <span slot ="action10text">When importing FirebaseAnalytics, I noted down that the ExternalDependencyManager is version 1.2.177. This is the one that's compatible with the firebaseAnalytics I'm using </span>

                    <span slot ="action11text">Also noticed that firebase analytics has dependencies on firebase app version 11.6.0</span>

                    <span slot ="action12text">After importing, some errors appeared. One related to XCode -which may be due to the platform I'm on since I'm using windows. A popup window appeared as well, I clicked Enable</span>

                    <span slot ="action13text">After I click enable, another window appeared. I am waiting for it to load...for a long time. I closed it and tried pressing play and exit play mode. The errors and the same window will reappear.</span>

                    <span slot ="action14text">I tried pushing to github, but file size too big. To resolve this I added "*.bundle filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text" in .gitattributes. This is for lfs files. </span>

                    <span slot ="action15text">I tried making a build just to see if a build can be made. It has been building for over 2 hours. So I cancelled it (forced closed cause cancelled was taking hours as well). Discarded my changes. Made a new branch. Created a new firebase project but this time only for Android. I still get Resolver issues and long building times. Turns out it was because my file path (the parent folder!!!) had a space in it. After removing the space > reopend the project > Android Resolver finished and I can make a build that finished in under 10 minutes.</span>
                    <span slot ="action16text">I want to try to log some events. I followed this <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup#prerequisites">documentation</a> and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2GQx--69q8">Youtube Video</a> to initialize firebase. Then followed this <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/unity/events">documentation</a> to log events. The initialization appears to only occur once as the Debug.Log only printed the first time I tested in the editor.</span>
