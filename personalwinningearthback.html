                <span slot ="situation">I took a course with Circuit Stream and I was allowed to create a project of anything I wanted. I decided to make a spiderman like game</span>
                <span slot ="task">This was my first time building on a Oculus platform and creating a large project in Unity. My task was to famliarize myself with Unity first and figure out what I want in my game and how to implement them. For the most part, I did not have access to a rift, so I had to learn how to test using PC mode with WASD for head movement and mouse to shoot to simulate headset and controllers</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">Biggest challenge was transferring what I imagined on paper into reality. Since this game was my idea, I was the only person who knew how I want the scene to look like. For each scene I create, I would first draw it on paper, then write a flow chart of how the weapons would work. I would then start coding them in Unity</span>

                <span slot ="action4text">Then I do a test run with basic shapes and then will either import fbx objects from the asset store or create them from Blender. Objects made in blender included balloons, web, airplane, puffer fish villian</span>

                <span slot ="result1text">My main menu looked like my draft and I was very proud as I got the button interactions and scene changes functioning</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/WinningEarthBack/SpideyHeroMainMenuWEBGoodCopy.PNG" slot="result1image">
                <span slot ="result2text">I also got a websling scene working and the concept matched my draft. I programmed the logic to allow the user to swing the boxes into a collider that would push the box into the airplane</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/WinningEarthBack/SpideyHeroGoodCopyWebSling.PNG" slot="result2image">
                <span slot ="result3text">Target practice scene was the most satisfying and hardest to implement as I added counters when the user hit the balloon targets. After the counter htis a number, the goblin would fly out of a portal. Based on a timer, the goblin would throw pumpkin bombs. I also implemented joints on the mail box to make the target practice more fun</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/PersonalProjects/WinningEarthBack/SpideyHeroGoodCopyShootingScene.PNG" slot="result3image">
                <span slot ="result4text">The last level where the pufferfish appeared, I had to apply materials to different parts of the pufferfish which was made in blender. I used abstract classes to add different health to different pufferfish. I also implemented a health bar for the pufferfish. Having the airplane moving worried me because of locomotion, but since the user was at the BACK of the plane and staring to the front only, locomotion ended up not being an issue</span>
