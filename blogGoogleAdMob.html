                    <span slot ="action1text">The main goal of this blog is to learn about Google AdMob. If I can implement it, then great, if not at the very least learn what the different google ad types are. I am going to test out Google AdMob in Unity. This was inspired by GameHive's "Battle Run" and "Tap Titans 2" which can be found on google play. They had reward ads. I want to do some test ads to see if I can implement ads into my Tomato vs Potato game. I will be following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/quick-start#android">Get Started</a> documentation</span>

                    <span slot ="action15text">I want to see if I can sideload aab builds. I may need to use a converstion tool because Android App Bundles is the default publishing format for apps on the Google Play Store. But Android devices require .apk files to install applications. I've been waiting for the build for over 4 hours now</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/GoogleMobileAds11.PNG" slot="action15image">
                    <span slot ="action16text">While I was waiting, I thought about making a Google play console account, but it requires $25 USD payment. Depending on if I can sideload or not, I may or may not purchase this</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/GooglePlayConsolePaymentPage.PNG" slot="action16image">
                    <span slot ="action17text">While I wait. Let's see what types of Google AdMob ads there are based on the Get Started Documentation. First one is <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/banner">Banner ads</a>. According to the documentation "rectangular image or text ads that occupy a spot on screen. They stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, and can refresh automatically after a certain period of time".</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/bannerads.png" slot="action17image">
                    <span slot ="action18text">Next is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial">Interstitial ads</a>. According to the documentation, these "are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game. When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app." </span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/interstitialads.PNG" slot="action18image">
                    <span slot ="action19text">Next is the <a href="">native ads</a>. "Native ads are ad assets that are presented to users through UI components that are native to the platform. They're shown using the same types of views with which you're already building your layouts, and can be formatted to match your app's visual design" </span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/nativeads.PNG" slot="action19image">
                    <span slot ="action20text">Lastly, my favourite one, <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded">rewards ads</a> These ads "reward users for watching short videos and interacting with playable ads and surveys. Used for monetizing free-to-play apps" which is used in games like "Battle Run" and "Tap Titans 2". For example, in Battle Run after you finish a game, you can press a button called "Bonus Rewards" watch an add to get coins</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/BattleRunRewardAd.jpg" slot="action20image">
                    <span slot ="action21text">Tap titans 2 has reward ads when you go back into the game. They will have a "Welcome back" message and  if you press the "Extra rewards" button, it let you watch ads to get the rewards</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/TapTitanWelcomeBackRewardAd.jpg" slot="action21image">
                    <span slot ="action22text">Tap titans 2 also has reward ads during the game. There will be fairy carrying a treasure chest, when you tap on the fairy, a window will appear asking if you want to watch ads to get rewards like coins or gems or power ups</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/TapTitansRewardAd.jpg" slot="action22image">
                    <span slot ="action23text">It's been 7 hours and the aab is still building. I'm cancelling the build and going to try following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKL3k-Uk5JU">tutorial</a> to see if I can get ads appearing in the editor first. I kept all my code the same, except the LoadAd() is called in Start()</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/GoogleMobileAds12.PNG" slot="action23image">
                    <span slot ="action24text">The Banner ad appears in the editor!)</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/GoogleMobileAds13.PNG" slot="action24image">
                    <span slot ="action25text">However, everytime I modify the code and save, or quit play mode. The command line appears and the "Resolve Android Dependencies" window keep opening and stay at 0%. The console would have an error saying "InvalidOperationException: StandardIn has not been redirected". It seems like it had to do with a path issue, where if the path has a apostrophe or space, this error could occur. To test, I copied and pasted the project into the D: Drive. I opened the project and the "Resolve Android Dependencies" would start running.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/GoogleMobileAds14.PNG" slot="action25image">
                    <span slot ="action26text">That's it for this blog. I've learned 4 different types of ads from google admob, how to import the sdk, how to setup a basic banner test ad and how to created an admob account</span>
