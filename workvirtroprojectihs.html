                <span slot ="action1text">I needed to understand how the human body works to simulate how the body functions. I need to understand how the movements occur for the throat, esophagus and stomach. I watched multiple videos provided by IHS. These videos were the point of view of the endoscope. I can see how the tools come out, how polyps are removed, and how the body moves such as contractions. After watching the videos, I would implement movements for the esophagus, cardia, stomach, pylorus and duodenum</span>
