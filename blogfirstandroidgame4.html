                    <span slot ="action1text">This is part 4 of making my first Android Game. If you missed part4, you can find it <a href="blogfirstandroidgame3.html">here</a></span>
                    <span slot ="action2text">I am following the tutorial to create photon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93SkbMpWCGo">here</a>.Time to add in Photon so my game be a multiplayer game. First I created an app on Photon dashboard. I selected PUN as the photon type</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon1.PNG" slot="action2image">
                    <span slot ="action3text">I then imported the Photon unity asset called PUN 2 free<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922">here</a></span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon2.PNG" slot="action3image">
                    <span slot ="action4text">I created a new scene and named it Loading with a Loading text. I created an empty gameobject called "ConnectToServer" and attached a script called "ConnectToServer" that calls PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings()</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon3.PNG" slot="action4image">
                    <span slot ="action5text">I added a Lobby scene and created two inputfields and buttons for create and join. Added to callback functions into ConnectToServer script. They are OnConnectedToMaster() and OnJoinedLobby(). This allowed the loading scene to load into lobby</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon5.PNG" slot="action5image">
                    <span slot ="action6text">Now that was a basic way to connect to the lobby. I wanted to allow users to enter their names. So I started following this tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y69wBS13wwA&t=161s">here</a>. In my start menu I removed the one and two player button. I replaced them with an input field for the user to enter their name and a button to connect to the lobby. The PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings(); gets called if the user has entered a name and pressed the connect button. The button text will display "Connecting..." while trying to enter the lobby. One thing to note that I changed in ConnectToServer script in the OnConnectedToMaster() callback function is that the code PhotonNetwork.JoinLobby was removed. I made a build with the main menu scene, lobby scene and game scene, the player's movement are still synched up. PhotonNetworkJoinLobby will let master see the list of rooms. In my case, I don't want the user to see all the rooms available, but the master will create the room and tell the client what room to join. Another idea which I'm not sure if I'll implement is do display all the rooms available but if the client wants to join the room they'll have to enter a password</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon14.PNG" slot="action6image">
                    <span slot ="action7text">After a quick search. It appears that the rooms cannot be password protected. However, looking at the Demo asteroid from the PUN asset, I can specify the maximum number of players. This will allow friends to join each others room and maxout the number of players and avoid strangers joining them if they don't want others to join. This means I can either go with my first route and have the client enter the room name to join the master's room. Or display all the room so that anyone can play with each other but have a max number of players in case master only wants to play with friends. The problem with the second route is this game is only implemented for two players</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/maxnumberplayers.PNG" slot="action7image">
                    <span slot ="action8text">Looking more into the demo asteroid game, when the players join the room, they will need to click "ready"</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/clickready.PNG" slot="action8image">
                    <span slot ="action9text">Once all players have clicked ready, the "Start game" button appears. If the master clicks ready and then the client joins the room, the start game button will be disabled and reenabled until the client clicks ready</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/clickstartgame.PNG" slot="action9image">
                    <span slot ="action10text">In the game, the score is displayed on the top for each user. The score for a player and the player itself will disappear if that player drops out</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/gamedisplayscore.PNG" slot="action10image">
                    <span slot ="action11text">The next step is to improve the lobby scene so that instead of a create and join button, replace it with a create, display rooms, join, and display players. First step was to remove the CreateAndJoinRooms.cs with LobbyManager.cs. The LobbyManager.cs in the Lobby scene first disables the room panel which will display the players is in this room. There is a create button that let's the host create a room. I hardcoded it so there can be only a maximum of 2 players. All the code does is create a room and display the room name in the room panel</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon15.PNG" slot="action11image">
                    <span slot ="action12text">The rooms created will need to be displayed in the lobby panel. The OnRoomListUpdate() function is called when PhotonNetwork.JoinLobby is called so I can get the list of the rooms. I created a prefab with a image and textmeshpro UI to de displayed in the scrollview. These prefabs are instantiated by checking how many rooms there are. I made sure to keep only Scrollbar Vertical so user can only scroll vertically. I also added the Vertical Layout Group component on the ScrollView > ViewPort > Content gameobject. The code was working but the placement of the UIs was not, the prefab which is spawend under Content does not get displayed properly. </span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon16.PNG" slot="action12image">
                    <span slot ="action13text">The prefab (roomItem) that gets spawned does not show the text. I double checked the textmeshpro component and the text does show the room name. It appears the text is not within the Content gameobject's rect transform.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon17.PNG" slot="action13image">
                    <span slot ="action14text">In addition, when I add multiple roomItem prefabs under the Content gameobject. The roomItem prefabs are stacked on top of each other</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon18.PNG" slot="action14image">
                    <span slot ="action15text">However, when I add plain images, they are displayed properly like the way the vertical layout group is intended to do. This tells me something is wrong with my prefab-maybe because of the Canvas gameobject in the roomItem prefab?</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon19.PNG" slot="action15image">
                    <span slot ="action16text">I unpacked prefab completely for the roomItem prefab.I unchilded the images and text out of the roomitem gameobject. The text and image are doing what the vertical layout group is expecting!</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon20.PNG" slot="action16image">
                    <span slot ="action17text">I then childed the image and text under the Canvas gameobject but unchilded the Canvas from the roomItem gameobject. The Canvas are doing what the vertical layout group is expecting! So issue is childing the Canvas,text and image under the roomItem</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon21.PNG" slot="action17image">
                    <span slot ="action18text">My solution is to redo roomItem but this time creat roomItem from UI > Button(TMP). Then attach the RoomItem script which will set the text to the room name. I quickly added multiple roomItem prefab under Content to see if it will be displayed properly - it did!</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon22.PNG" slot="action18image">
                    <span slot ="action19text">I then tested in the game where on mobile the host creates a room called "host created a room", and the editor which is the client will join the room. The lobby panel will display the room!</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon23.PNG" slot="action19image">
                    <span slot ="action20text">The lobby panel displays the rooms created, but the client can't click on the buttons displayed in the lobby panel. So when the button is clicked I call PhotonNetwork.JoinRoom(). This will then call the OnJoinedRoom() function</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon24.gif" slot="action20image">
                    <span slot ="action21text">Currently the user cannot leave the room when they are in the room Panel. So the Join Room Button is replaced with the Leave Room Button. PhotonNetwork.LeaveRoom is called which will call OnLeftRoom().</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon25.PNG" slot="action21image">
                    <span slot ="action22text">When we leave the room, the list of rooms needs to be updated. To do that PhotonNetwork.JoinLobby needs to be called again. We can call this in the callback function OnConnectedToMaster(). OnConnectedToMaster() is called because LeaveRoom() is called - remember LeaveRoom() is defined as "Leave the current room and return to the Master Server where you can join or create rooms "</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon26.PNG" slot="action22image">
                    <span slot ="action23text">The OnRoomListUpdate() callback function gets called in quick successions. So a timer is added to prevent the UpdateRoomList() to be called multiple times</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon27.PNG" slot="action23image">
                    <span slot ="action24text">Now the host can create and leave rooms. The client can join and leave rooms as well</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon28.gif" slot="action24image">
                    <span slot ="action25text">Then with a little UI update so the lobby is consistent with other scenes</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon29.gif" slot="action25image">
                    <span slot ="action26text">Next task is to list the players that have joined the room. I created a PlayerItem prefab that contains a textmeshpro component which will be the player's name. The image which will be the player's avatar. In this case, the hat,arm would be the same for now. I will be changing the body only. There are arrow buttons on the player item prefab as well</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon30.PNG" slot="action26image">
                    <span slot ="action27text">After I added an image containing a horizontal layout group which will list out the players in the room.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon31.PNG" slot="action27image">
                    <span slot ="action28text">With the PlayerItem prefab created, I can spawn the PlayerItem prefab into the game. I made a function called UpdatePlayerList(). This functions will first clear the player List, check if the room exist then spawn all the playersItems into the Panel. This function is called during OnPlayerEnteredRoom(Photon.Realtime.Player newPlayer), OnPlayerLeftRoom(Photon.Realtime.Player otherPlayer),OnJoinedRoom()</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon32.PNG" slot="action28image">
                    <span slot ="action29text">I would Instantiate the PlayerItemPrefab under "Listing" gameobject. As shown in the gif below, the playerItem are spawned when a player joins or leaves the room</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon33.gif" slot="action29image">
                    <span slot ="action30text">The PlayerItem currently does not display the Player's name. The Photon.RealTime.Player has a property called "NickName". So when UpdatePlayerList is looping through the Photon.RealTime.Player list, I pass in the value from the key value pair player, I would have access to the player which then allows me to get access to Photon.RealTime.Player.NickName</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon34.PNG" slot="action30image">
                    <span slot ="action31text">All the PlayerItem will display the player's NickName!</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon35.PNG" slot="action31image">
                    <span slot ="action32text">To allow the players to select a customized avatar, I will modify PlayerItem script. As explained in the youtube tutorial, to synchronize across the network for the modifications we make in the room, we will make custom properties using ExitGames.Client.Photon.Hashtable. I will have an Image called playerAvatar that will change the image of the avatar and an array of sprites that contains all the avatars that the user can change to. The Left arrow and right arrow will loop through the array. To make sure the changes are sent across the network, we will call PhotonNetwork.SetPlayerCustomProperties(), passing in the property.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon36.PNG" slot="action32image">
                    <span slot ="action33text">The OnPlayerPropertiesUpdate() callback function will be called on everyone of the player items each time a property has been modified on the network and will be stored in the targetPlayer of type Photon.RealTime.Player. We will check if the player is itself the call the UpdatePlayerItem() function. This function checks if it contains the playerAvatar key in the custom properties, then assign the image to the sprite. We will save the avatar that we choose so that if we leave the room and come back, the same avatar is chosen. However, if the player does not have the synchronized custom property yet, we will set the playerProperty["playerAvatar"] to 0.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon37.PNG" slot="action33image">
                    <span slot ="action34text">In the SetPlayerInfo function, we assign the Photon.Realtime.Player to the player being passed in and call UpdatePlayerItem() so that we update the player avatar once at the very start when we join the room</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon38.PNG" slot="action34image">
                    <span slot ="action35text">In the LobbyManager.cs, OnClickCreate() function, where PhotonNetwork.CreateRoom is called. We will add another room options after the MaxPlayers, called BroadcastPropsChangeToAll and set it to true. This tells Photon we want to send and receive custom properties in this room </span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon39.PNG" slot="action35image">
                    <span slot ="action36text">I then dragged all the sprites I want the player to change to into the sprites array</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon40.PNG" slot="action36image">
                    <span slot ="action37text">Now the players can see what avatar the other player chooses. One problem is I can click on the arrow buttons of the other player. Although, clicking them won't change other player's avatars - it does change my own avatar.</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon41.gif" slot="action37image">
                    <span slot ="action38text">To resolve the arrow button being clickable. I disable the arrows on the prefab. In PlayerItem I create a function called ApplyLocalChanges() and enable this function. This function would be called in LobbyManager.cs UpdatePlayerList() function. I would change if player is the local player, if it is call ApplyLocalChanges()</span>
                    <img class="diarypostimage" src="images_videos/blog/FirstAndroidGame/photon42.PNG" slot="action38image">
                    <span slot ="action39text">Now only the local player can see their own arrow buttons</span>

                    <span slot ="action40text">The next step is to add a play button that will appear for the host only. The play button will transition all the players in the room to the game scene. In the Update() function, I will check if it is the master client. If yes, enable the Play button, otherwise disable the play button.</span>

When I made the build and tested, the client will throw an error when trying to get the explosions: <p style="color:red">ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.</p> The explosions pool objects were 0 for the client.</span>
