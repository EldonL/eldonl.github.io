        <section class="star bg-js-controlled">
            <workprojectstar-component>
                <span slot ="situation">My company received funding from Canadian DND from the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) program. My team was required come up with and Media Briefing Simulation, Performance Review Simulation and Event Planning Simulation prototypes. </span>
                <span slot ="task">My task was to implement the login, lobby and a part of the Performance Review Simulation (PE). The lobby is a place for the user to select which simulation they would like to practice. PE lets learners have the opportunity to improve their listening, speaking, and comprehension abilities through the process of evaluating their subordinates' performance. By doing so, they can provide valuable feedback that is both effective and constructive, ultimately promoting growth and improvement within the workplace.</span>
                <span slot ="action1text">The login was originally implemented in <a href="workvirtroprojectjis.html">BeConfident</a>. What was different was we wanted to add localization. English AND French. At the time when this was implemented, all our apps were only in English. Adding another language was mind blowing. We wanted to let the user choose a language in login. This was the language that the text will be in. With the help of the framework team, I helped add a language selection into Login. When the app launches, a language selection window will appear. After the user selects a language, a login screen appears. After they enter their credentials, a consent form will appear. The consent form will appear in the language the user selected at the start. However, this language may be what the user wants to practice in and not necessarily what they are fluent in. This caused a problem because the user must understand what they are agreeing to. Therefore, I added a toggle button to switch between English and French. When the user selects agree, I must change the language back to what the user selected at the start. Below is NOT an image of the game, it's an image from google showing proof Canada's official language - the reason why we used French and English for this app </span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/dnd/officialLanguage.PNG" slot="action1image">                
                <span slot ="action2text">The lobby was also originally implemented in <a href="workvirtroprojectjis.html">BeConfident</a>. In the lobby, I would be sent a list of scenarios used in this app. My task was to sort the scenarios by alphabetical order - English or French. Using the IComparable interface, I can sort the scenarios alphabetically. I also had to add an image to each scenario. Depending on which category the scenario fell under, an assigned image needed to be attached. I originally tried using the category name to match the images. However, this caused an issue because the category name can be in English and French. Therefore, I used the category ID instead. This allowed me to use a switch statement to assign the images to the scenarios. Since I cannot share my code from work, below is an image of IComparable from Microsoft website, because Microsoft has amazingly detailed documentation on C#</span>
                <img class="starimage" src="images_videos/ProfessionalExperience/virtro/dnd/Icomparable.PNG" slot="action2image">                
                <span slot ="action3text">I also had to add an option in the lobby for users to select "Staggered" vs "Full presentation". However not all scenarios have this option. Only the Media Briefing Simulation category has this option. My approach was to make these scenarios a prefab. The scenarios look like cards with image, buttons and text. I would add a toggle button to the prefab. When the user enters the lobby, while I'm sorting the scenarios in alphabetical order, I would check if this scenario is part of the Media Briefing Simulation Category. If yes, enable the toggle button otherwise disable the button. When the user selects an option, I would make the program remember this option. This way when I enter the Media Briefing, I can pass that information to the developer developing Media Briefing. This let's that developer decide what to implement depending on what I send him/her. In addition, this allows both of us to work on different part of the code at the same time without worrying how the other person implements their scenes</span>

                <span slot ="action4text">My focus was on login and lobby so for PE simulation, I was more on the code design and code review side of things. We wanted to implement a conversation between the user and the AI character (AIC). This is where the user asks a question and the AIC will respond with an answer. We discussed how the AIC will enter the scene, how to start the conversation and what happens when the conversation finishes. We made sure there would be a smooth transition from each stage. The reason is so the animation for the AIC will seem natural as the AIC will stand and sit down. In addition, we had to make sure the microphone (which detects if the user is talking) is enabled or disabled depending if it is the user's turn or AIC's turn to talk. We made sure to track everything that was said and send this information back as a report for DND to analyze. This allows them to help improve their speaking skills</span>

                <span slot ="result1text">The login and lobby are not public so I can't share those screenshots. However, PE simulation is public on our website, and below are the results! The first one shows the conversation being tracked which gets sends to our backend</span>

                <span slot ="result4text">Because of login scene's localization, I was later tasked with standardizing the login scene for all of our VR and WebGL apps. This is so we can apply the same logic and reuse it.</span>
                <span slot ="result5text">We have completed stage 1a and have been offered to continue working on stage 1b</span>
